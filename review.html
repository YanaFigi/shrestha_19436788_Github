		<h3>The Discord app works with desktop and mobile platforms, combining the features of a chat lobby, a message board and a VoIP chatting system into one app that's not going to hog resources on your phone or PC.</h3>
		<ph><h3>Discord's popularity has only multiplied in recent years, with the app now reaching over 90 million registered users. If you're looking to get a group together for PUBG, communicate easily to an entire server of Minecraft players or just hang out online with a small group of friends, then you should keep reading to learn what this growing platform offers.</h3></ph>
		<h2><ph>What makes Discord better than other VoIP services (like Skype)?</ph></h4>
		<h3>If you want just to talk with a small group of friends while playing some games, both Skype and Discord will get the job done. However, Discord stands out by giving you the option to run the app in a browser, letting you change individual people's mic levels and offering an overall lower-latency voice chat, which helps when talking to people across the globe.If you've installed the Discord app on your PC, you can access it through an overlay while playing games. Then, you can either tweak audio levels or type something quickly without having to alt/tab to another window.</h3>

		<h3>Sublime was released back in 2007, so it's had almost a decade to mature. According to Stackoverflow's 2016 developer survey it's the 3rd most popular Development Environment.</h3>
		<ph><h3>V3 Beta is its latest version and while it's been in beta for a long time now, don't let that concern you. The product is actually very stable.</h3></ph>
		<ph><h2>Package</h2></ph>
		<ph><h3>Any Sublime user will tell you the first package they install is Sublime Package Control plugin. I think we all secretly hope that Sublime 3 will add this by default.Like Atom, Sublime has a lot of packages and themes! For me the essentials are:</h3></ph>
		<ph><h3>SideBarEnhancements: without this, renaming/moving/duplicating files is not supported.</h3></ph>
		<ph><h3>SublimeLinter: To add linters for different languages</h3></ph>
		<ph><h3>GitGutter - Shows git status on the left side next to line numbers.</h3></ph>
		<ph><h3>There's plenty more to choose from, too. Overall, Sublime's package support is very good, it's just a shame that you have to jump through that one hoop at the beginning to even get started with it.</h3></ph>
